# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Tableau
In This Project I have tried creating Dashboard Using Tableau using the Road Accident Dataset. 
The dataset contains data from year 2018 - 2020.
The dashboard conatins KPI's inicating increasing or decrease in the no of accidents, casualties, types of casualties.
Moreover dashbaord provides the insight  regarding accident based on their geographical location, weather conditions, road type etc.
